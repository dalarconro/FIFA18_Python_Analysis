    "Before starting our analysis, we have to take into consideration some issues about our dataset. In order to work only with data regarding relevant players, we have filtered our dataset by their 'International Reputation'. We have also dropped rows with missing values in the following columns: 'Name', 'Overall', 'Potential', 'International Reputation' and 'Position'. Although with this transformation we have keep only elite or high professional players, we may have biased or distorted our analysis, specially when making some aggregation groupping by 'Club' or 'Nationality'."
